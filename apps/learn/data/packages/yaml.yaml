descrizione: "
  yaml is a definitive library for YAML, the human friendly data serialization standard. This library:

  Supports both YAML 1.1 and YAML 1.2 and all common data schemas,
  Passes all of the yaml-test-suite tests,
  Can accept any string as input without throwing, parsing as much YAML out of it as it can, and
  Supports parsing, modifying, and writing YAML comments and blank lines.
  The library is released under the ISC open source license, and the code is available on GitHub. It has no external dependencies and runs on Node.js as well as modern browsers.

  For the purposes of versioning, any changes that break any of the documented endpoints or APIs will be considered semver-major breaking changes. Undocumented library internals may change between minor versions, and previous APIs may be deprecated (but not removed).
