# ZION - Network State

Zion is a network state based on Music. We are building a
community which shall be united by a strong ideology of
collectivism with the sole aim to make the people of the
community thrive and live a life full of meaning. There for
we are building an Operative System for the DLT technologies
world.

## About the Repo

This repo contains the open source software which will
constitute a solid base for the relazation of all the
informatic technologies needed by the community to crate,
design, project, develop, produce and distribute contents
and goods. </br>Obviously this repo at the time being is
just a first small step towards the ambitious goal.</br>

> ZION follows the DIY concept. We manifestly do pretend to
> own our contents and not rely on third parties
> data-centers. Our applications will grow with the
> engagement of the community, so expect some plain html on
> some pages!

# Constitution

> Zion constitution will be realized through a collective
> effort and it will be deployed on the blockchain.
